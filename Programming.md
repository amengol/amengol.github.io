These are some of the Programming Projects that I was actevely developing during the Game Development - Advanced Programming course.

### Server/Client Chat Application

We were supposed to develop a Server/Client Chat application. It was most used to achieve a better notion of Network Programming and all the application was developed in C++ using BSD Sockets. A tricky part of it was develop a basic protocol for it, and a serialization/deserialization process to change numbers from Little Endian to Big Endian. 
There was a second assigment that built upon the first one where we were supposed to add an Authentication Server for the system using Google Protocol Buffers and also use MySQL to store all user login informations.
