Hi, I'm Jorge Amengol and as I started learning about Design Patters, I decided to write these articles to be a kind of insight, especially to me, on how a specific Design Pattern should work with a practical example, using C++ to code it. Keep in mind that I'm not trying to be rigorous with it, and the insight that I mentioned is basically how I'm explaining the patter to myself, so I can go back to it in the future and see how I once understood it or even change it a little bit if I get it wrong or not quite right the first time.

I decided to make these series public as I'm writing because it may help others like me that are starting to scratch the surface of Design Patters to understand it better by the code and examples that I'm giving here.

As a final note, some code here is inspired by Professor M. Feeney's classes at Fanshawe College in the course Game Development - Advanced Programming (Fall 2017). He is really a skilled professor when it comes to make you understand hard topics turning it into simple things.

### Introduction

Design Patters, putting in a simple language, are like recipes on how you solve common design problems with well-known best practices that hundreds of other professionals have used with success for the same kind of problem that you may face.

If you noticed well, I give a generalized idea for Design Patters and didn't even mentioned word "software" yet, because it is indeed a general concept for all areas where you have to solve specific common problems. This is so true that the famous Design Patters book (Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software) was inspired by a 1977's architecture book called "A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction". 

The idea is that there is always a patter for something well known. For instance, how do you know the difference between a bedroom and a living room? You may say that there is a bed in a bedroom, right? Although you are not totally wrong, did you ever visited an empty house or apartment and was able to tell where the living and bed room was?

The idea is the same for software too. If you are building one, the chances are that you will encounter Design problems that may have, and usually has, a specific or even more than one Design Patter that you can use to solve that problem. That is, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, you may use a Pattern to help you go through that problem.

It is important to keep in mind though that a Design Patter is not a ready to use code. You have first to understand the problem and the pattern to be able to use it efficiently. You have to adapt it to your specific needs and language.
