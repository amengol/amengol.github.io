Hi, I'm Jorge Amengol, a fresh graduate student of the [Game Development - Advanced Programming](https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs-and-courses/program/gdp1-game-development-advanced-programming/next-year){:target="_blank"} course at [Fanshawe College](https://www.fanshawec.ca/){:target="_blank"}, Canada. I started this series of posts to register my own progress throughout the program and also serve as a reference for me on important subjects in the future. Though it is a personal record, you might find the subjects discussed here useful. Feel free to make comments at the end of each post.

### My First OpenGL - A triangle

Well, we have to start Graphics Programming somewhere and it seems that we got the most simple example at class today: this triangle:

![OpenGL triangle]({{ "/img/2017-09-08/triangle.png" | absolute_url }})

The real thing was more exiting though. It was rotating...

The code used to build that triangle was basically taken from [here](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html){:target="_blank"}

The problem is that there is so much concepts and OpenGL API calls to draw that simple thing that I almost regret doing this course. Why don't we have a simple `draw rotating multicolor triangle` there? :D

It seems though, once we master the basics concepts, we can draw whatever we want and not just basic geometry.

I can't wait!
