Hi, my name is Jorge Amengol. I'm a Computer Scientist and Aviation enthusiast.  Computers and the love for flying has motived most of the things I have accomplished in life, like becoming a Software Engineer, a Graphics Programmer, a Flight Simulator Scenery Designer and Animator and even a Pilot.

This blog is dedicated to one of my passions: Computer Graphics

As my interest about Computer Graphics grew, I decided to dig deep on it and on April 2018 I have post-graduated from the Fanhsawe's [Game Development - Advanced Game Programming](https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs-and-courses/program/gdp1-game-development-advanced-programming/next-year){:target="_blank"}. It was an amazing journey and I'm still impressed by the number of things I've learned during that course and how we manage to produce a Game Engine by the end of it.

After that and for my surprise I've receive a job offer to work as a Software Engineer developing code for an Aerospatial Company to work with an aviation software and I've been doing that since then, which is an amazing job by the way as I've got to do everything I love in the same place. 

Please take a look at my [Portfolio]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link Projects.md %}) for all relevant recent projects.  

Jorge Amengol.
