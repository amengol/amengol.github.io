Hi, my name is Jorge Amengol. I'm a Computer Scientist with passion about `Computer Graphics` and `Games`.  

I have been playing with video-games and computers since my early childhood and that led me to a genuine interest in get to know the inners of a computer and how it really works. From there I became a **Computer Scientist** and finally a **Graphics Programmer**.  

As my interest about Computer Graphics grew, I decided to dig deep on it and Recently I have post-graduated from the Fanhsawe's [Game Development - Advanced Game Programming](https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs-and-courses/program/gdp1-game-development-advanced-programming/next-year){:target="_blank"} course with excellent grades and achievements. 

Please take a look at my [Portfolio]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link Projects.md %}) for all relevant recent projects.  

Jorge Amengol.
