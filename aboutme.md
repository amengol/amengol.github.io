Hi, my name is Jorge Amengol. I'm a Computer Scientist with passion about making `experiences`, aka games and also about flying.

Before talking about me, please know that this `about me` is not a cold conventional one where I just put my experience and there it is. It does have really `something about me`.

Early in my childhood when I started discovering console games I became fascinated about them. How could they move a picture in the screen? How they "knew" when I had pushed a button? That was simply *magic* for me, but then I have been told that there was no such thing like magic.

Again, I was fascinated on how a plane managed to fly. How could it be? A giant aircraft flew over my head and I started to wonder: what does push it upwards? That was simply *magic* to me too, but then again I was told that there was no such thing like magic.

Well, long story short (the long one I can tell in a bar) here I'm: A Computer Scientist, a Game Programmer and a FAA Pilot.

However, I did discover that there is such thing like magic, it is not just what I expected. The magic was that I could learn how to do those things that fascinated me. This was when my interest about computers and aviation flourished.

You might be wondering then if I have the time for being a commercial pilot and a game programmer at the same time. Well, I didn’t say I was a commercial pilot and in fact, that path was not my goal when I started to fly in the first place. I’m passionate about flying, not about being a “commercial pilot”. If I had been born with wings, problem would be solved already. In other words, what I like to do is to take a small plane and feel the joy of flying, `experience` it.

Same thing goes for games and programming. But here I did decide to go ahead and pursuit a career. 

Being passionate about computers and aviation soon brought me to Flight Simulators. But only “flying” with them wasn’t enough. I needed to create something, to make my own scenery there. Then, following some tutorials, I kind of recreated  my [own city](http://fsbirdhouse.blogspot.ca/2010/12/sao-luis-photoreal.html){:target="_blank"} inside the simulator (at the same time I started to take some flying lessons).

The thing with making DLCs and ultimately games is that after you have shipped one you never want to stop making more. After recreating my city I went for more projects and did about half dozen of [them](http://fsbirdhouse.blogspot.ca/){:target="_blank"}. That was a hobby for me, but then I started making animations too for Flight Simulators and things became serious. People started to reach me to make Flight Simulators more [lifelike](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQRI4GFL6REVO1k4Nmcy3nCDFGEaSpCy_){:target="_blank"}.

After some time making animations I realized that I was limited by the Flight Simulator's engine, where I could not make an interactive animation supported directly by it without programming. It only supported loop animations. That was by the time I had finished my Computer Science degree and had the chance to invest some time programming and trying to implement a kind of custom animation system inside the Simulator's engine.

From that idea came the one to move to a place where Game Development was taken more seriously and invest real time trying to specialize myself in **Game Programming**. So here I am in London, Canada, at the final semester of the post-graduate Fanshawe's [Game Development - Advanced Game Programming](https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs-and-courses/program/gdp1-game-development-advanced-programming/next-year){:target="_blank"} course.


At last, but not to be the least, I have this lovely “First Officer” that embarks with me in every journey that I take. My wife! :)

That's all for this post and if you came down here, please feel free to contact me be by any means in this page.

Good to have had you onboard,

Jorge Amengol.
